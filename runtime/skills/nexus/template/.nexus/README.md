# .nexus/

Route and impact tracking scaffold for this repository.

## Files

### Hand-authored

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `routes_rules.yaml` | Controls which files become route nodes (exclude globs, promoted file patterns). Edit before first sync if the defaults don't fit the project. |
| `impact-notes.yaml` | Free-form authoring surface. Write plain-language descriptions of nodes and relationships in `pending`. |
| `impact-rules.yaml` | Rule catalog mapping intent kinds to scopes. Extend when adding new impact categories. |

### Script-generated

These files are fully overwritten on each sync. Do not edit manually.

**`routes.yaml`** — route tree built from git-visible files.

```bash
python .nexus/scripts/sync_routes.py
```

**`impact.yaml`** — compiled impact graph built from `impact.intent.yaml`.

```bash
python .nexus/scripts/sync_impact_graph.py
```

**`route-index.json`** — cache joining routes and impact. Always run last.

```bash
python .nexus/scripts/sync_route_index.py
```

### Agent-written

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `impact.intent.yaml` | Resolved entries from `impact-notes.yaml`. Written by the agent during sync; do not edit manually. |

## Typical sync order

```bash
python .nexus/scripts/sync_routes.py
python .nexus/scripts/sync_impact_graph.py
python .nexus/scripts/sync_route_index.py
```

Or invoke `/nexus` via the agent to run the full sync workflow.
